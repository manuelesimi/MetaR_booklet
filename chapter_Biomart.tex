\section{Overview}
The BioMart project provides free software and data services to the international scientific community. We choose to implement it in MetaR. Our User can now Download data from the Biomart Registry which contains  wide range of research data. Similarly to EdgeR an Limma, the language that provides the Biomart statement must be added to the model. To do so, you can pressed Control+L and write The name of the language, org.campagnelab.metar.biomart.
\section{The Biomart Statement}
The \texttt{query Biomart} statement allow you to download tables from the Biomart registry.It Implement both a java Classes to query the web service and the Biomart package to download the data. The statement has the following parameters. Figure~\ref{fig:NewLimmaVoom} presents a newly created Biomart statement.

\begin{description}
\item[boolean] if this criteria is present or not on your ouput table
\item[text] you have to enter a text in this place for example GO term
\item[list] if this criteria is present, you can filters your results from a set of predifine values
\item[id list] you can restric your results from a set of ids. This ID can come from a Set Of IDs define before the statement, or directly from an annotated with an (ID column) table.
